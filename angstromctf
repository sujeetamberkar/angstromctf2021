    Identify the cipher using 
    "https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier#bifid-cipher"
    to establishit as a substitution cipher    
    Use brute force to find a meaningful key 
    Use that key to decode the last line and find the flag.

Relatively Simple Algorithm
  use p and q to find n, phi
  n=p*q
  phi = ( p - 1) * ( q - 1 )
  e=65537
  d = inverse(e,phi)
  m= pow ( c, d, n)
  print(hex(m) [2:-1].decode('hex'))
